This is the homepage for intermine.org.

Quick notes - the site is newly re-launched! We don't have a build process in place yet, and we haven't removed the old site contents from the repo.

## Updating the site

1. The primary content is here: https://github.com/yochannah/intermine-homepage-2017 - visit this repo and make the changes you like. There is documentation about how to make changes in the [README](https://github.com/yochannah/intermine-homepage-2017/blob/master/README.md).
2. When you've made changes to your satisfaction, generate the site using the command `hugo` if you haven't already and then cop/paste the root directory from that repo into your local copy of *this* repo. Merge/overrwrite any older files if your OS prompts you. 
3. Commit and push to this repo on the master branch. 
4. Thanks ot the magic of gh-pages, it will automatically be live on intermine.org! Well done!

TODO: Make automatic deployment process and remove old jekyll content.
