We're excited to have you join the community. InterMine integrates biological data, but you don't have to be a biologist to contribute to InterMine. Some of our entry-level issues only require knowledge of the relevant programming language, but others may require more in-depth understanding. If you’d like to learn a bit more about InterMine, we have a nice 5 minute video for you to sum things up. If you prefer textual learning resources, you could look at the InterMine documentation for a technical overview of InterMine’s server, the user documentation a for a biologist/bioinformatician oriented overview, or you could hop straight into our Python tutorial to learn more about querying our data model.</description></item><item><title>New to open source?</title><link>http://intermine.org/contributing/new-to-open-source/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://intermine.org/contributing/new-to-open-source/</guid><description>Perhaps you’ve never made a pull request before, or you’ve used git a little but never collaboratively? Have a look through the open source guide to submitting contributions to give you a good idea of how things work. Some of our issues are marked first-timers-only - these are issues that may be relatively straightforward, where we’ll happily walk you through steps you’re unsure about. (psst, you can also search GitHub for all issues marked with this label, not just InterMine).</description></item><item><title>Contributing - tickets to try</title><link>http://intermine.org/contributing/tickets-to-try/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://intermine.org/contributing/tickets-to-try/</guid><description>Interested in helping out?
